      <i>Julius Caesar</i> (French: Jules CÃ©sar), is a sculpture by French sculptor Nicolas Coustou comissioned by King Louis XIV in 1696.
      The sculpture is a portrait of the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, the last emperor of the Roman Republic. The sculpture 
      was made to pair with with a statue of the Carthaginian general and statesman Hannibal by the artist Sebastien Slodtz.
      Both Caesar and Hannibal are considered some of the most famous figures in history in ancient history.
