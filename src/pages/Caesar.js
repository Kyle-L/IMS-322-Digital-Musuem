      <i>Julius Caesar</i> (French: Jules CÃ©sar), is a sculpture by French sculptor Nicolas Coustou comissioned by <TooltipWrapper label={'Louis XIV was King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in history; much of which he is considered to have focused on fine arts over politics.'}>King Louis XIV</TooltipWrapper> in 1696.
      The sculpture is a portrait of the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, the last emperor of the Roman Republic. The sculpture
      was made to pair with with a statue of the Carthaginian general and statesman Hannibal by the artist Sebastien Slodtz.
      Both Caesar and <TooltipWrapper label={'Hannibal was a Carthaginian general and statesman who commanded the forces of Carthage in their battle against the Roman Republic during the Second Punic War. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history.'}>Hannibal</TooltipWrapper> are considered some of the most famous figures in history in ancient history.

      Tuileries, the oldest square in Paris. However, this is only a moulding of the sculpture, and the sculpture is resides
      in the private archives of the Louvre Museum.
